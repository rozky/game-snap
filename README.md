Blink interview challenge

## Assigment

The task is to simulate a game of snap between two players using standard playing card decks.

Requirements

* The application should ask the user how many playing card decks to play with
* The application should ask the user whether cards should be matched: on suit, value or both
* The application should shuffle the decks before play commences
* Games of snap should then be simulated between two computer players. Cards are played one at a time and when two matching cards are dealt one after another the first player to 'shout' snap wins (include some randomness)
* The winner of each round collects all the cards dealt in this round
* Once all cards are exhausted the application should declare the winner based on who has the most won cards
